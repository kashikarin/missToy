## Description

It features an intuitive design, responsive layout, and a smooth management experience for adding, editing, and removing toys.

## Main Features

- üé® **Responsive & Theme-Friendly:**  
The app is fully responsive on both desktop and mobile.

## Toy Object Structure
Each toy in the system is represented as an object in the following format:

```js
{
  _id: 'PTXZFW',
  name: 'Play Doh3',
  price: 91,
  labels: ["art"],
  createdAt: 1760571851320,
  updatedAt: 1760648685420
  status: true,
  imageUrl: "toy-images/PlayDoh.png"
}

## Services
```js
export const toyService = {
    query,
    getById,
    getToyLabels,
    save,
    remove,
    getEmptyToy,
    getDefaultQueryOptions,
    getToyImageUrl,
    getQueryOptionsFromSearchParams
}

Explanations: 
- query(queryOptions) ‚Äì retrieves a filtered and sorted list of toys
- getById(toyId) ‚Äì fetches details of a specific toy
- getToyLabels() - dynamically retrieves all existing toy labels from the current toy dataset, so filtering options reflect only the toys currently in stock or matching the query
- getEmptyToy(name, labels) - creates a basic empty toy for creating a new toy
- remove(toyId) ‚Äì deletes a toy
- save(toy) ‚Äì adds or updates a toy
- getDefaultQueryOptions() - returns a set of default settings for a toy filter query. The function creates an object with initial values ‚Äã‚Äãfor filtering and sorting.
- normalizeQueryOptions(rawOptions) - ensure that all filter and sort values ‚Äã‚Äãin the toy filter are in a correct and clear format before running.
- getQueryOptionsFromSearchParams(searchParams) - read the filter and sort parameters from a URL and convert them into a queryOptions object ready to be used in the query() function.
- getToyImageUrl(name) - returns an image url according to the name of the toy.

## App logic & state management
MissToy is a frontend-only React application powered by Redux for state management.
All user interactions (such as adding, editing, deleting, or filtering toys) trigger Redux actions, which update the store and automatically re-render the UI.

### Redux Structure
The app uses two main reducers to manage its global state:

#### üß© `toyReducer`
Handles everything related to toys:
- **State fields:**  
  - `toys` ‚Äì the current list of toys (filtered or full)  
  - `queryOptions` ‚Äì current search, filter, and sort settings  
- **Actions:**  
  - `SET_TOYS` ‚Äì set the full toy list  
  - `REMOVE_TOY` ‚Äì remove a toy by ID  
  - `ADD_TOY` ‚Äì add a new toy  
  - `UPDATE_TOY` ‚Äì update an existing toy‚Äôs data  
  - `SET_QUERYOPTIONS` ‚Äì update current filter and sort options  

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `systemReducer`
Handles app-wide system settings:
- **State fields:**  
  - `colorTheme` ‚Äì current theme (`'light'` or `'dark'`)  
  - `isLoading` ‚Äì whether data is currently being fetched  
  - `isMobile` ‚Äì screen size detection (`true` if width < 1000px)  
- **Actions:**  
  - `SET_COLOR_THEME` ‚Äì toggle between light/dark modes  
  - `SET_ISLOADING` ‚Äì control loading spinner visibility  
  - `SET_MOBILE` / `SET_DESKTOP` ‚Äì update responsive state  

### Combined Store
Both reducers are combined in the Redux store (e.g. via `combineReducers`),  
allowing the app to maintain a **clean separation** between toy data and system state.
